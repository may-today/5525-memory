# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

5525 Memory is a replay webapp of Mayday #5525 live tour.

## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:
- Run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

## Code Style Notes

- Prefer `interfaces` over `type` aliases
- Use JSDoc for all public methods
- Boolean functions must use `isX` / `hasX` / `canX` naming

## Journey memory

Use `journey/` as the shared project memory across agent sessions.

- Read `journey/design.md` first at the start of each session. It is the canonical snapshot of the project: current strategy, key design decisions, trade-offs, constraints, and scope.
- Use `journey/logs/` for chronological process notes, progress, experiments, and failed paths.
- Use `journey/research/` for research notes and background findings.
- Update `journey/design.md` whenever the effective understanding of the project changes. Do not leave important decisions or trade-offs only in logs.

For any new project, planning-focused request, or sufficiently complex task, start with a fresh plan and write it to `journey/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{title}.md` before implementing. Treat files in `journey/plans/` as the canonical plans. As work progresses, record concise updates in `journey/logs/YYYY-MM-DD-{title}.md` using the same date and title convention. In chat, provide only a brief summary and the relevant file path(s).
